# Quantum Optics in Extended SSH lattices
Codes used in the paper 'Qubit-photon bound-states in topological waveguides with long-range hoppings' by Carlos Vega, miguel Bello, Diego Porras and Alejandro Gonz√°lez-Tudela. The code is structured in three Jupyter notebooks:

1. Extended SSH Bound States: Computation of the bound states wavefunction when a quantum emitter coupled to the bulk of an extended SSH photonic environment is spectrally tuned at different energy band-gaps of the bath hamiltonian spectrum.

2. Disorder: Numerical demonstration of robustness against disorder of these bound states.

3. QEs Dynamics: Computation of the dynamics of a giant atom coupled the edge of an extended SSH lattice, exhibiting sensitivity to the topological invariant for small number of unit cells.
