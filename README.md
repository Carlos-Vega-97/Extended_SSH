# Qubit-photon bound states in extended SSH lattices
Codes used in the paper 'Qubit-photon bound-states in topological waveguides with long-range hoppings' by Carlos Vega, miguel Bello, Diego Porras and Alejandro Gonz√°lez-Tudela. The code is structured in several Jupyter notebooks:

1. Self-energy in the extended SSH model: Numerical computation of the self-energy of a quantum emitter interacting with an extended SSH bath. The real and imaginary parts of this quantity, which determine the renormalized energy and lifetime of the emitter in the Markovian regime, are plotted in different regions of the model parameter space.

2. Extended SSH Bound States: Computation of the bound states wavefunction when a quantum emitter coupled to the bulk of an extended SSH photonic environment is spectrally tuned at different energy band-gaps of the bath hamiltonian spectrum.

3. Disorder: Numerical demonstration of robustness against disorder of these bound states.

4. Giant atoms in the extended SSH model: Tunability in the bound states wavefunctions through non-local couplings is numerically proved by introducing a giant atom in the extended SSH bulk.

5. QEs Dynamics: Computation of the dynamics of a giant atom coupled the edge of an extended SSH lattice, exhibiting sensitivity to the topological invariant for small number of unit cells.
